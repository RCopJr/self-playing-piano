# Deep Learning Pianist

Here is the current code for the deep learning pianist web app. This app utilizes neural networks to generate classical piano compositions and play them for the user through a self-playing piano on the site's main page. This is mainly a prototype and is still undergoing improvement.

*Other files (the models) are too big to commit to the repo, so this code is comprised of the Flask application only.*
