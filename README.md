# Deep Learning Pianist

This app utilizes neural networks to generate classical piano compositions and play them for the user through a self-playing piano on the site's main page. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZZUFEg1qQc) for a quick listen.

*Other files (ex. the models) are too big to commit to the repo, so this code is comprised of the Flask application only.*
